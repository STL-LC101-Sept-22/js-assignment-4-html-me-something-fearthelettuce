        <section class="text-section">
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            This section provides general guidance on growing all of the
            carnivorous plant genus' listed here. Any deviations from this
            guidance will be explained in the individual genus section.
          </p>
          <h4>Water</h4>
          <p>
            Almost all carnivorous plants need water with low Total Dissolved
            Solids (TDS). Depending on where you live, your tap water may be ok,
            however most people will need to use a different source. The most
            common sources are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rain water</li>
            <li>
              Distilled water, easily found in grocery stores in gallon jugs
            </li>
            <li>
              Tap water that has been filtered thorough a Reverse Osmosis filter
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As far as actually watering your plants, they should keep them moist
            but not soggy. While many people are successful with their plants
            sitting in trays, I recommend top watering regularly and letting the
            the water freely drain away.
          </p>
          <h4>Lighting</h4>
          <p>
            I grow all my plants under LED grow lights, specifically HLG 65 V2
            4000K and Florawave P80 You sent
          </p>

          <h4>Fertilizer</h4>
          <p>
            Nepenthes can be fertilized either through foliar spray or by
            directly fertilizing the pitchers. I usually apply fertilizer once
            every 2-4 weeks and I rotate between three types of fertilizers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Maxsea - kelp based fertilizer that is mixed with water and
              sprayed on leaves and in pitchers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Osmocote - pellets that can be placed in pitchers and will release
              slowly when temperatures rise above 75F.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nutricote - pellets that can be placed in pitchers and will
              release slowly with exposure to water/pitcher fluid.
            </li>
          </ul>

              <h2>Nepenthes Care</h2>
            </a>

          <section class="care-guide">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              Nepenthes are a genus of carnivorous plants primarily from
              Southeast Asia. The pitchers are modified leaves that trap insects
              and digest them for nutrition.
            </p>

            <h4>Humidity</h4>
            <p>
              Some nepenthes can adapt to normal room level humidity, however in
              my experience, all nepenthes do better with supplemental humidity.
              I keep mine between 75-90% RH
            </p>
            <h4>Lighting</h4>
            <p>
              Light requirements vary by species and as such, you should
              research the natural conditions of yours species. Generally, most
              nepenthes grow in a forest and are shaded for much of the day,
              thus they don't need particularly high light levels.
            </p>
            <h4>Potting Media</h4>
            <p>
              Most nepenthes do well in a loose draining mix of long-fibered
              sphagnum moss and perlite. I also use coco husk chips, although
              it's important to find a brand that has low salt content.
            </p>
            <h4>Temperature</h4>
            <p>Nepenthes generally fall into one of three categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Highland - these plants live on mountains that get high humidity
                and cool nighttime temperature
              </li>
              <li>
                Intermediate - plants that live between the highland and lowland
                areas and can adapt to a wide range of conditions. Intermediate
                species and hybrids are recommended for beginners.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lowland - these plants live at low elevations in hot, humid
                environments
              </li>
            </ul>

              <h2>Heliamphora Care</h2>
            </a>
          </header>
          <div class="care-guide">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              Heliamphora are a genus of carnivorous plants exclusively from
              South America. They live on highland plateaus called Tepuis. These
              tepuis get an incredible amount of rain which makes it difficult
              for many plants to grow since the rain washes away much of the
              nutrients in the soil. Heliamphora have adapted to live in this
              environment by catching water in their pitchers and using it to
              digest insects for nutrition.
            </p>

            <h4>Water</h4>
            <p>
              Heliamphora follow the normal watering guidelines listed above,
              however since they live in an area of especially heavy rain, I
              usually give them more water than my other plants.
            </p>

            <h4>Humidity</h4>
            <p>
              Heliamphora need supplemental humidity to thrive. I keep mine
              between 75-90% RH.
            </p>
            <h4>Lighting</h4>
            <p>
              Heliamphora will take as much light as you can give them. When
              given enough light, most species will have beautify red
              coloration.
            </p>
            <h4>Potting Media</h4>
            <p>
              I used the same mix as nepenthes, a loose draining mix of
              long-fibered sphagnum moss and perlite. I also use coco husk
              chips, although it's important to find a brand that has low salt
              content.
            </p>
            <h4>Temperature</h4>
            <p>
              I grow all my Heliamphora at intermediate conditions, with no
              significant temp drop at night.

              <h2>Cephalotus Care</h2>
            </a>
          </header>
          <div class="care-guide">
            <h4>Lighting</h4>
            <p>
              Cephalotus appreciate high light levels and develop beautiful
              coloration when given these conditions.
            </p>

            <h4>Watering</h4>
            <p>
              Cephalotus can tolerate sitting in trays a bit more than
              Nepenthes, although root rot is one of the primary killers of
              Cephalotus so it's important that they dry out between waterings.
            </p>

            <h4>Humidity</h4>
            <p>
              I haven't found Cephs to be particularly picky about humidity. I
              grow mine in my basement freely open to the room air.
            </p>
            <h4>Media</h4>
            <p>
              I use a mixture of peat, sand and pumice. I usually add a top
              layer of lava rock or slate primarily for aesthetics, although
              this does also prevent moss and algae from growing in the pot.
