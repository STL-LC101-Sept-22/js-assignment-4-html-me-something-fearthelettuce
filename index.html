            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              This section provides general guidance on growing all of the
              carnivorous plant genus' listed here. Any deviations from this
              guidance will be explained in the individual genus section.
            </p>
            <div class="text-item"><img src=".\icons\water-icon.svg" alt="humidity icon" class="icon" title="Water">
            <p>
              Almost all carnivorous plants need water with low Total Dissolved
              Solids (TDS). Depending on where you live, your tap water may be
              ok, however most people will need to use a different source. The
              most common sources are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Rain water</li>
              <li>
                Distilled water, easily found in grocery stores in gallon jugs
              </li>
              <li>
                Tap water that has been filtered thorough a Reverse Osmosis
                filter
              </li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              As far as actually watering your plants, they should keep them
              moist but not soggy. While many people are successful with their
              plants sitting in trays, I recommend top watering regularly and
              letting the the water freely drain away.
            </p>
            <h4>Lighting</h4>
            <p>
              I grow all my plants under LED grow lights, specifically HLG 65 V2
              4000K and Florawave P80 You sent
            </p>

            <h4>Fertilizer</h4>
            <p>
              Nepenthes can be fertilized either through foliar spray or by
              directly fertilizing the pitchers. I usually apply fertilizer once
              every 2-4 weeks and I rotate between three types of fertilizers:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Maxsea - kelp based fertilizer that is mixed with water and
                sprayed on leaves and in pitchers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Osmocote - pellets that can be placed in pitchers and will
                release slowly when temperatures rise &#62; 75F.
              </li>
              <li>
                Nutricote - pellets that can be placed in pitchers and will
                release slowly with exposure to water/pitcher fluid.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <section class="care-guide">
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                Nepenthes are a genus of carnivorous plants primarily from
                Southeast Asia. The pitchers are modified leaves that trap
                insects and digest them for nutrition.
              </p>

              <div class="text-item"><img src=".\icons\humidity-icon.svg" alt="humidity icon" class="icon" title="Humidity">
              <p>
                Some nepenthes can adapt to normal room level humidity, however
                in my experience, all nepenthes do better with supplemental
                humidity. I keep mine between 75-90% RH
              </p></div>
              <h4>Lighting</h4>
              <p>
                Light requirements vary by species and as such, you should
                research the natural conditions of yours species. Generally,
                most nepenthes grow in a forest and are shaded for much of the
                day, thus they don't need particularly high light levels.
              </p>
              <h4>Potting Media</h4>
              <p>
                Most nepenthes do well in a loose draining mix of long-fibered
                sphagnum moss and perlite. I also use coco husk chips, although
                it's important to find a brand that has low salt content.
              </p>
              <h4>Temperature</h4>
              <p>Nepenthes generally fall into one of three categories:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Highland - these plants live on mountains that get high
                  humidity and cool nighttime temperature
                </li>
                <li>
                  Intermediate - plants that live between the highland and
                  lowland areas and can adapt to a wide range of conditions.
                  Intermediate species and hybrids are recommended for
                  beginners.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lowland - these plants live at low elevations in hot, humid
                  environments
                </li>
              </ul>

            </header>
            <div class="care-guide">
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                Heliamphora are a genus of carnivorous plants exclusively from
                South America. They live on highland plateaus called Tepuis.
                These tepuis get an incredible amount of rain which makes it
                difficult for many plants to grow since the rain washes away
                much of the nutrients in the soil. Heliamphora have adapted to
                live in this environment by catching water in their pitchers and
                using it to digest insects for nutrition.
              </p>

              <div class="text-item"><img src=".\icons\water-icon.svg" alt="humidity icon" class="icon" title="Water">
              <p>
                Heliamphora follow the normal watering guidelines listed above,
                however since they live in an area of especially heavy rain, I
                usually give them more water than my other plants.
              </p>
              </div>
              <div class="text-item"><img src=".\icons\humidity-icon.svg" alt="humidity icon" class="icon" title="Humidity">
              <p>
                Heliamphora need supplemental humidity to thrive. I keep mine
                between 75-90% RH.
              </p>
              </div>
              <h4>Lighting</h4>
              <p>
                Heliamphora will take as much light as you can give them. When
                given enough light, most species will have beautify red
                coloration.
              </p>
              <h4>Potting Media</h4>
              <p>
                I used the same mix as nepenthes, a loose draining mix of
                long-fibered sphagnum moss and perlite. I also use coco husk
                chips, although it's important to find a brand that has low salt
                content.
              </p>

              <p>
                I grow all my Heliamphora at intermediate conditions, with no
                significant temp drop at night.

                Cephalotus appreciate high light levels and develop beautiful
                coloration when given these conditions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Cephalotus can tolerate sitting in trays a bit more than
                Nepenthes, although root rot is one of the primary killers of
                Cephalotus so it's important that they dry out between
                waterings.
              </p>
              </div>
              <div class="text-item"><img src=".\icons\humidity-icon.svg" alt="humidity icon" class="icon humidity-icon" title="Humidity">
              <p>
                I haven't found Cephs to be particularly picky about humidity. I
                grow mine in my basement freely open to the room air.
              </p>
              </div>
              <div class="text-item"><img src=".\icons\soil-icon.svg" alt="soil icon" class="icon soil-icon" title="Media">
              <p>
                I use a mixture of peat, sand and pumice. I usually add a top
                layer of lava rock or slate primarily for aesthetics, although
                this does also prevent moss and algae from growing in the pot.
              </p>

                  Cephalotus grow well at a wide range of temperatures.  They can tolerate heat into the 90s and can handle temperatures into the 40s.
