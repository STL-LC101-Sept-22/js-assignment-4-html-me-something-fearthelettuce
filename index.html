          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            This section provides general guidance on growing all of the
            carnivorous plant genus' listed here. Any deviations from this
            guidance will be explained in the individaul genus section.
          </p>
          <h4>Water</h4>
          <p>
            Almost all carnivorous plants need water with low Total Dissolved
            Solids (TDS). Depending on where you live, your tap water may be ok,
            however most people will need to use a different source. The most
            common sources are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rain water</li>
            <li>
              Distilled water, easily found in grocery stores in gallon jugs
            </li>
            <li>
              Tap water that has been filtered thorough a Reverse Osmosis filter
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As far as actually watering your plants, they should keep them moist
            but not soggy. While many people are successful with their plants
            sitting in trays, I recommend top watering regularly and letting the
            the water freely drain away.
          </p>
          <h4>Lighting</h4>
          <p>I grow all my carnivorous plants under LED grow lights.</p>

          <h4>Fertilizer</h4>
          <p>
            Nepenthes can be fertilized either through foliar spray or by
            directly fertilizing the pitchers. I usually apply fertilizer once
            every 2-4 weeks and I rotate between three types of fertilizers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Maxsea - kelp based fertilizer that is mixed with water and
              sprayed on leaves and in pitchers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Osmocote - pellets that can be placed in pitchers and will release
              slowly when temperatures rise above 75F.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nutricote - pellets that can be placed in pitchers and will
              release slowly with exposure to water/pitcher fluid.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section class="text-section">
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Nepenthes are a genus of carnivorous plants primarily from Southeast
            Asia. The pitchers are modified leaves that trap insects and digest
            them for nutrition.
          </p>

          <h4>Humidity</h4>
          <p>
            Some nepenthes can adapt to normal room level humidity, however in
            my experience, all nepenthes do better with supplemental humidity. I
            keep mine between 75-90% RH
          </p>
          <h4>Lighting</h4>
          <p>
            Light requirements vary by species and as such, you should research
            the natural conditions of yours species. Generally, most nepenthes
            grow in a forest and are shaded for much of the day, thus they don't
            need particularly high light levels.
          </p>
          <h4>Potting Media</h4>
          <p>
            Most nepenthes do well in a loose draining mix of long-fibered
            sphagnum moss and perlite. I also use coco husk chips, although it's
            important to find a brand that has low salt content.
          </p>
          <h4>Temperature</h4>
          <p>Nepenthes generally fall into one of three categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Highland - these plants live on mountains that get high humidity
              and cool nighttime temperature
            </li>
            <li>
              Intermediate - plants that live between the highland and lowland
              areas and can adapt to a wide range of conditions. Intermediate
              species and hybrids are recommended for beginners.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lowland - these plants live at low elevations in hot, humid
              environments
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Heliamphora Care Guide</h2>
        </a>
      </header>
      <div class="article-content">
        <section class="text-section">
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Heliamphora are a genus of carnivorous plants exclusively from South
            America. They live on highland plateaus called Tepuis. These tepuis
            get an incredible amount of rain which makes it difficult for many
            plants to grow since the rain washes away much of the nutrients in
            the soil. Heliamphora have adapted to live in this environment by
            catching water in their pitchers and using it to digest insects for
            nutrition.
          </p>

          <h4>Water</h4>
          <p>
            Heliamphora follow the normal watering guidelines listed above,
            however since they live in an area of especially heavy rain, I
            usually give them more water than my other plants.
          </p>

          <h4>Humidity</h4>
          <p>
            Heliamphora need supplemental humidity to thrive. I keep mine
            between 75-90% RH.
          </p>
          <h4>Lighting</h4>
          <p>
            Heliamphora will take as much light as you can give them. When given
            enough light, most species will have beautify red coloration.
          </p>
          <h4>Potting Media</h4>
          <p>
            I used the same mix as nepenthes, a loose draining mix of
            long-fibered sphagnum moss and perlite. I also use coco husk chips,
            although it's important to find a brand that has low salt content.
          </p>
          <h4>Temperature</h4>
          <p>
            I grow all my Heliamphora at intermediate conditions, with no
            significant temp drop at night.
          </p>

      </header>
      <div class="article-content">
        <section class="text-section">
          <h4>Lighting</h4>
          <p>
            I grow mine under LED grow lights, specifically HLG 65 V2 4000K and
            Florawave P80 You sent
          </p>

          <h4>Watering</h4>
          <p>
            Always use rainwater or reverse osmosis water. I have done a mixture
            of top watering and tray watering. I think both work fine, the key
            is not too much water. Regardless of which method you use, the tray
            should mostly dry out between waterings, these are not bog plants.
          </p>

          <h4>Humidity</h4>
          <p>
            I haven't found Cephs to be particularly picky about humidity. I
            grow mine in my basement freely open to the room air.
          </p>
          <h4>Media</h4>
          <p>
            I use a mixture of peat, sand and pumice. You can also use perlite,
            however I don't like how it tends to float to the top of the media -
            pumice stays in place. I usually add a top layer of lava rock, sand,
            or slate chips primarily for aesthetics, although lava rock and
            slate prevent algae and moss from growing.
          </p>
          <h4>Fertilizer</h4>
          <p>
            When grown indoors, my cephs don't usually catch anything. I
            fertilize open pitchers every 3-6 weeks with either Maxsea, Osmocote
            pellets, or Nutricote pellets.
          </p>
